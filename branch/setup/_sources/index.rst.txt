High Performance Data Analytics in Python
=========================================

Scientists, engineers and professionals from many sectors are seeing an enormous 
growth in the size and number of datasets relevant to their domains. 
Professional titles have emerged to describe specialists working with data, 
such as data scientists and data engineers, but also other experts are finding 
it necessary to learn tools and techniques to work with big data. Typical tasks 
include preprocessing, analysing, modeling and visualising data.

Python is an industry-standard programming language for working with data on 
all levels of the data analytics pipeline. This is in large part because of the rich 
ecosystem of libraries ranging from generic numerical libraries to 
special-purpose and/or domain-specific packages, often supported by large developer 
communities and stable funding sources.

This lesson is meant to give an overview of working with research data in 
Python using general libraries for storing, processing and analysing and sharing data. 
The focus is on high performance. After covering tools for performant 
processing on single workstations the focus shifts to parallel and distributed 
computing.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This material is for all researchers and engineers who work with large or small 
datasets and who want to learn powerful tools and best practices for writing more 
performant, parallelised, robust and reproducible data analysis pipelines.




About the course
